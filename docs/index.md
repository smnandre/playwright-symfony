# Playwright Symfony Bundle

This bundle provides a first-class integration of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) into the Symfony ecosystem. It
allows you to run high-fidelity functional and E2E tests using real browsers while routing requests directly into the
Symfony Kernel.

## Key Features

- **Real Browser Testing**: Fully supports JavaScript, CSS animations, and complex DOM interactions.
- **Fast Performance**: Optimized shared browser process architecture reduces startup overhead by reusing the same
  browser process across test methods.
- **Kernel Interception**: No local web server required. Browser requests are intercepted and handled directly by your
  Symfony application.
- **DomCrawler Bridge**: Continue using the familiar Symfony `Crawler`, `Link`, and `Form` APIs while driving a real
  browser.
- **Asset Serving**: Built-in support for serving static assets and AssetMapper content during in-process tests.
- **Seamless DX**: Modern assertions and magic properties that feel exactly like native `WebTestCase`.

## Why Playwright Symfony?

Standard Symfony functional tests use `BrowserKit`, which lacks JavaScript support. `symfony/panther` provides
JavaScript support but requires a running web server and uses WebDriver.

**Playwright Symfony** bridges this gap by allowing you to test real browser behavior (JavaScript, AJAX, SPAs) with the
speed and ease of in-process Kernel testing.
