# DomCrawler Integration

The Playwright Symfony bundle provides full support for Symfony's `DomCrawler` component. This allows you to use the
familiar selection and extraction API from `WebTestCase` while driving a real, JavaScript-enabled browser.

## How it Works

The integration bridges the gap between the static HTML snapshots used by `DomCrawler` and the live, interactive DOM of
a real browser.

1. **Selection**: Use CSS or XPath selectors via the Crawler to find elements.
2. **Extraction**: Extract standard Symfony `Link` or `Form` objects.
3. **Interaction**: Pass these objects back to the client. The client automatically translates them into Playwright
   locators, performs the action in the browser, and returns a fresh Crawler for the new page state.

## Basic Usage

In a `PlaywrightTestCase`, the `$this->client` (and the magic `$this->page` property) work together to provide this
bridge.

```php
public function testNavigationWithDomCrawler(): void
{
    // Start by visiting a page
    $this->visit('/');

    // Get the crawler for the current page
    $crawler = $this->client->getCrawler();

    // Find a link using standard CSS selectors
    $link = $crawler->filter('a#dashboard-link')->link();

    // Click it using the BrowserKit API
    // This triggers a real click in Chromium/Firefox/WebKit
    $this->client->click($link);

    // Assert on the new state
    $this->assertStringContainsString('/dashboard', $this->client->getPage()->url());
}
```

## Form Handling

Interacting with complex forms is simplified by the `DomCrawler` integration. It handles all input types, including
selects, checkboxes, and file uploads.

```php
public function testFormSubmission(): void
{
    $crawler = $this->client->request('GET', '/registration');
    
    $form = $crawler->selectButton('Register')->form();
    
    // Fill the form using standard Symfony syntax
    $this->client->submit($form, [
        'user[email]' => 'test@example.com',
        'user[password]' => 'password123',
        'user[terms]' => true,
    ]);

    // The submission happens in the real browser, executing any JavaScript validation
    $this->assertPageContains('Welcome to your account');
}
```

## Benefits of the Bridge

### Familiar API

You don't need to learn a new selection API. All the power of `filter()`, `filterXPath()`, `selectLink()`, and
`selectButton()` is available.

### Real Browser Fidelity

Unlike standard `WebTestCase`, calling `click()` or `submit()` through the bridge:

- Triggers JavaScript `click` and `submit` events.
- Handles AJAX requests triggered by those events.
- Executes CSS transitions and animations.
- Respects `target="_blank"` and other browser-native behaviors.

### Automatic State Synchronization

The bridge includes a synchronization layer (`CookieJarSync`) that ensures cookies set by the browser (via JS) and
cookies set by Symfony (via Headers) are always consistent within your test session.

### Asynchronous Resilience

The client includes built-in retry logic to handle cases where the Crawler attempts to retrieve content while the
browser is still actively navigating or rendering a page.
