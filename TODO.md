## 🚀 Phase 6: Future Roadmap (Post v0.1.0)

### From Original ROADMAP.md - Long-term Improvements

#### Audit Follow-ups
- [ ] **Multipart parsing:** Add fuzz/regression coverage (binary uploads, nested boundaries, malformed filenames) around the new `HeaderUtils`-driven parser
- [ ] **Dependency stability:** Keep `playwright-php/playwright` pinned to released tags; add CI guardrails that fail when `composer.lock` drifts back to `dev-main`
- [ ] **Client semantics:** Document clearly that `PlaywrightClient` cannot be used via `AbstractBrowser::request()` and provide guidance for users expecting BrowserKit flows
- [ ] **Profiler + base URL:** Ensure the profiler token lookup continues to work after future kernel changes and keep the `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` parameter documented
- [ ] **Redirect limitation:** Track the known limitation where real-browser redirects can bypass interception (leading to `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`) and explore mitigation

#### Assets Enhancement
- [ ] **Structured debug logs:** Emit logs for asset hits/misses (hooked into `playwright.debug_logging`) so users can trace why a request fell back to the kernel
- [ ] **Service-tag hook:** Document and implement a service-tag hook so custom `AssetLocatorInterface` implementations can be registered from applications

#### BrowserKit Bridge Enhancement
- [ ] **Network tracker:** Add a lightweight network tracker so BrowserKit responses capture status/headers from the last main-frame request
- [ ] **PHPUnit trait:** Publish a reusable PHPUnit trait/base test case that spins up the BrowserKit bridge with fixtures and artifact capture (HTML/screenshot on failure)
- [ ] **Demo suite:** Build a demo suite exercising navigation, clicks, multipart submits, cookies, auth headers, and popup flows
- [ ] **Package extraction:** Re-evaluate whether to extract the bridge into a separate package

#### Test Suite Enhancement
- [ ] **Fixture subclass:** Build/extend the fixture subclass (`tests/Fixtures/Tests/TestablePlaywrightTestCase`) for better testing without real browsers
- [ ] **Environment tests:** Add tests covering all environment variables (`PLAYWRIGHT_E2E`, `PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS`, `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSER`, `PLAYWRIGHT_VERBOSE`)
- [ ] **Helper coverage:** Use fake browser/client implementations to verify all helpers (`visit`, `setCookie`, `authenticate`, `logout`, etc.)
- [ ] **Teardown coverage:** Prove fake browsers receive `stop()` and that `restoreExceptionHandlers()` fully unwinds stacked handlers

#### DX: Assertion Helper Expansion
- [ ] **MVP (v0.9.x):** Ship text + selector assertions (`assertPageHasText`, `assertSelectorTextContains`, `assertSelectorVisible`)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Add accessibility helpers (`assertRoleVisible`, `assertAriaState`) and document extension hooks
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Explore network/download assertions once Playwright telemetry APIs stabilize
- [ ] **Success metrics:** ≥40% reduction in boilerplate, 100% coverage for helper paths, zero BC-break reports

#### DX: Logging & Fixtures
- [ ] **Structured logging:** Use `logger.channel.playwright` to emit info/debug events (browser lifecycle, intercepted requests, asset cache hits/misses)
- [ ] **Verbosity controls:** Keep `playwright.debug_logging` + `PLAYWRIGHT_VERBOSE` precedence documented (env > config > default)
- [ ] **Fixture utilities:** Deliver a `FixtureLifecycleTrait` (plus Doctrine example) that wires `seedFixtures()` / `resetState()`
- [ ] **Docs & samples:** Update README tips, add `docs/logging.md` and fixture guide

#### Legacy Asset Bridge
- [ ] **Decision:** Decide whether the KernelBrowser-based `AssetMapperPlaywrightBridge` is still needed now that AssetServer exists
- [ ] **Action:** Either harden it (tests + docs) or deprecate it formally in favor of AssetServer

---

## 🚀 Phase 7: Post-Release Monitoring

### 6.1 Monitoring
- [ ] **Track issues** - Watch GitHub issues for bugs
- [ ] **Gather feedback** - Collect user feedback from early adopters
- [ ] **Performance baseline** - Measure test execution time vs traditional E2E approaches

### 6.2 Future Enhancements (v0.2+ Planning)
- [ ] PHPStan level 8 compliance (fix 127 type hint errors)
- [ ] Assertion helper expansion (accessibility, network assertions)
- [ ] Fixture lifecycle traits (FixtureLifecycleTrait mentioned above)
- [ ] Structured logging with context (logger.channel.playwright)
- [ ] BrowserKit bridge hardening (if separate package extraction planned)

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-04 19:00 CET
**Status:** Phase 1 + Phase 4 Complete - Ready for v0.1.0 release decision

## ✅ Recent Completions (2026-01-04)

### Phase 4.1: E2E Tests - COMPLETED ✅ (19:00)
- **Added 13 comprehensive E2E tests** covering critical user flows
  - Form handling: 3 tests (validation, errors, accessibility)
  - JavaScript interaction: 4 tests (evaluate, DOM access/modification, async)
  - Navigation & routing: 4 tests (links, back/forward navigation)
  - Error handling: 2 tests (400/200 status codes)

- **Coverage**: All core converter functionality now thoroughly tested

---

## 🎉 Cookie Test Fix Complete (2026-01-04 15:40)

### Problem Identified
Playwright's `addCookies()` requires `domain` parameter, NOT `url` parameter

### Fixes Applied
1. ✅ **Browser/PlaywrightBrowser.php**: `getContext()` now calls `ensureStarted()`
   - Ensures browser is started before accessing context
   - Prevents null context issues

2. ✅ **Client/PlaywrightClient.php**: `setCookie()` uses `domain`
   - Extracts domain from baseUrl: `parse_url($this->getBaseUrl(), PHP_URL_HOST)`
   - Cookies now properly added to browser context

3. ✅ **Client/PlaywrightClient.php**: `clearCookie()` uses `deleteCookie()`
   - Simplified to use native deleteCookie() method
   - Uses domain parameter consistently

### Test Results
- ✅ **CookieAndAuthE2ETest** passes in isolation (8 assertions)
- ⚠️ Fails when run with full test suite (test interaction issue)
- 🎯 **Overall:** 192/198 E2E tests passing (97%)

### Remaining Issues
- **3 errors:** `fill()` method doesn't exist (should be `locator()->fill()`)
- **2 failures:** Test interaction issues (cookies, form validation)
- **Action:** Need to investigate test isolation
